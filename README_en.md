## Introduction

**Chat Any** is a Raycast extension designed to help users quickly collect selected files, folders, or text content and aggregate them into a centralized text file.

## Features

- **Content Collection**: Automatically read selected text (or clipboard text), folders, or file contents.
- **Centralized Editing**: Aggregate the collected content into a `context.md` file, stored in the user's `Documents/Chat Any` directory, and edit it with Cursor.
- **Append Content**: Supports appending new content to the existing `context.md` file for continuous editing.

## Demo

### 1. Edit Selected Text

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Installed [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).
- Installed [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).

### Steps

## Usage

1. **Collect File Content**:

   - Select one or more files, folders, or text in Finder.
   - Activate the **Chat Any** extension using Raycast.
   - Execute the `Chat` command; the extension will automatically collect the selected content and **overwrite** the `context.md` file.

2. **Append Content**:

   - Select new files, folders, or text in Finder.
   - Activate the **Chat Any** extension using Raycast.
   - Execute the `Chat Append` command; the extension will automatically **append** the selected content to the `context.md` file.

3. **View Aggregated Content**:

   - After executing the command, the extension will automatically open the `Documents/Chat Any` directory and the `context.md` file for immediate viewing.

4. **Clipboard Operations**:

   - If no files or text are selected, the extension will attempt to read content from the clipboard and aggregate it.
